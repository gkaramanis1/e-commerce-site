## Installation
The packages needed to be installed are MySQL2 and sequelize to connect your express.js API to a database. Also, the dotenv package needs to be installed to store sensitive data, including your MySQL username, password, and the name of the database.

## Usage
To begin, the user must create the schema from the MySQL shell. The user will also have to seed the database from the command line. To start the application's server, run node server.js. Once the server is running, go to Insomnia Core and run the GET route for all the categores, products, and tags. Then also run the POST, PUT, DELETE routes for the categories, products and tags. You should be able to successfully create, update, and delete data in your database.
